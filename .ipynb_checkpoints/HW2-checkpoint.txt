How many earthquakes are listed in the table?
5959 Earthquakes
wc signif.txt.tsv
  5959 121932 816121 signif.txt.tsv


How many columns are in the table?
47 columns
head -1 signif.txt.tsv


Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.

cut -f 3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv  > Year_Mag_Country.tsv

EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.

enh2134@chopin:~/assignments$ sort Year_Mag_Country.tsv -k 2nr | head -10
1960     9.5    CHILE
1964     9.2    USA
2004     9.1    INDONESIA
2011     9.1    JAPAN
1700     9.0    USA
1952     9.0    RUSSIA
1716     8.8    PERU
1812     8.8    USA
2010     8.8    CHILE
1513     8.7    PERU

How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.
154 Countries
cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq | wc
    154     213    1606

Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY
$ grep -c 'USA' Year_Mag_Country.tsv
294


Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more than once.

$ grep -v 'USA TERRITORY' Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -c 'USA'
255

Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.

cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
    579 CHINA
    400 JAPAN
    365 IRAN
    363 INDONESIA
    324 ITALY
    319 TURKEY
    259 GREECE
    255 USA
    207 PHILIPPINES
    193 MEXICO

Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country USA.
grep -wc "$1" Year_Mag_Country.tsv
bash countEq.sh USA


Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country CHILE.
grep -w "$1" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | cut -f 2,3 |  sort -rn | head -1
bash countEq_getLargestEq.sh CHILE
 9.5    CHILE
Magnitude of the largest Earthquake in the country

Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.
cut -f 1,2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10
     10 1873
     10 1854
      9 1869
      9 1858
      7 1751
      6 1887
      6 1881
      6 1877
      6 1871
      6 1855
